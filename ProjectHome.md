.NET C# application which reads files containing signal sequences, searches for patterns on any signal aggregation level, and visualizes them using arc diagrams (1).

Signals can be any data like single letters, words, n-grams (combination of words), DNA bases {A, G, T, C}, musical notes etc. For each kind of signal file type an adapter needs to be implemented.

This application was inspired by (2) and is part of a series of articles for GermanyÂ´s largest .NET magazine: dotnetpro (http://www.dotnetpro.de).
